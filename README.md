# Strategic Data Project Education to Workforce Pathways Diagnostic Toolkit: Analytic code and guidance for using state longitudinal data to understand K12 student progression into postsecondary and the workforce. 
This repository contains Stata code and example
data to help education data analysts answer questions about education and workforce outcomes.


This repository is organized in the following folder structure:
- `stata code` contains the Stata code for the analysis
- `mock data` contains the mock data for the analysis. The data provided in this rep is mock data and is intended solely for illustrative, educational, and testing purposes. It does not reflect real-world values or actual entities. Any resemblance to real individuals, companies, or actual data is purely coincidental.
- `data_templates` contains templates with the data structure and contents necessary to complete the analyses
- `docs` contains Education to Workforce Pathways Diagnostic guides, which includes the Analysis Narrative, Technical Guide, and Diagnostic Overview

These materials were originally authored by Atticus Bolyard, Sue Dynarski, Jon Fullerton, Miriam Greenberg, Julia Lubner, Aleksei Opacic, Eric Taylor, and Rachel Worsham (listed alphabetically).
